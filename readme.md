# Semester Project: Gain characterization of pump DBR VECSEL in the 2-µm range

This repository contains the python code and LaTeX files for my semester project in the Ultra Fast Laser Physics group at ETH.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to investigate the gain saturation of a novel optically-pumped vertical external cavity surface emitting laser (VECSEL) operating in the 2-µm spectral range with an integrated DBR for the pump wavelength. For this, the nonlinear reflectivity of the chip is measured and fitted with a model based on the saturable absorption of SESAMS. 

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main folders:

- **latex**: Contains all LaTeX files for the thesis, including the main document, chapters, sections, and bibliography. It also includes any images, tables, or additional files used in the document.
- **python**: Contains the Python code for the data processing, fitting and plotting
