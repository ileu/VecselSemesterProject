\chapter{Introduction}\label{chapter:introduction}

Semiconductor lasers present a very compact compact, efficient and mass producible solid state laser. They have many applications in everyday life and science, such as optical communication, data storage, printing, sensing, medical treatment, and pumping solid-state lasers.

A special type of semiconductor laser is a VECSEL (Vertical External Cavity Surface Emitting Laser). It is based on a VCSEL (Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser) and emits light perpendicular to the surface of a semiconductor wafer but unlike a VCSEL, a VECSEL has an external cavity that is formed by one or more optical elements outside the wafer. This allows for more flexibility in designing the laser parameters, such as wavelength, output power, beam quality and pulse duration. VECSEL are also typically optical pumped whereas VCSEL are electrically pumped.

The basic structure of the VECSEL itself consists of an active region and a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR). Inside the active region, multiple quantum wells are located which are engineered to provide the necessary energy levels for the desired laser emission wavelength, in this case the 2-\unit{\um} range. This wavelength range is of strong interest for many application, particularly for medical purposes and atmospheric spectroscopy. The DBR is made of alternating layers of semiconductor material with different refractive indices. By choosing the optical layer thicknesses to be one quarter of the laser wavelength, the DBR achieves high reflectivity at the desired wavelength range of the laser. 

A novel design approach incorporates a DBR for the pump wavelength as well. This new structure shows remarkable improvements in terms of efficiency and power scaling in continuous wave (CW) operation, as seen in \cref{fig:pslope}. The performance improvements in a modelocked configuration were not as significant. To get a better understanding of this, additional investigation were conducted and for this work we focused on the gain saturation characteristics.

    \caption{Continuous wave (CW) output power of a VECSEL without pump DBR a) and with pump DBR b) versus pump power under different heat sink temperature ranging from \qtyrange{-10}{10}{\celsius}. The data demonstrates the effect of the pump DBR on the power scaling performance in CW operation. The VECSEL with pump DBR shows an increase of \qty{18}{\percent} in efficiency and a sixfold increase in output power.}
