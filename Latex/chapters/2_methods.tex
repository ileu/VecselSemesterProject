In order to accurately determine the characteristic parameters of a VECSEL chip, it is necessary to have an experimental setup that can measure a small change, in the order of \qty{0.1}{\percent} in the reflectivity over a dynamic range of about 4 order of magnitude in pulse fluence. A dedicated setup fulfilling these criteria has been constructed and utilized by  \cite{Gaulke2021HighCharacterization, Heidrich2021FullRegime, Mangold2012VECSELCharacterization}.

For the measurements, a total of 4 different VECSEL chip were used, with three of them having a different structure (further discussed in \cref{sec:vecsel}). We were interested on the impact of different pump powers and the temperatures on the characteristic parameters of the VECSEL across the three different structures. For this we measured the nonlinear reflectivity for each chip for 9 different pump powers in the range from \qtyrange{0}{16}{\watt} and for three temperatures \qtylist{-10;0;10}{\degreeCelsius}.

The subsequent section provide an overview of the different VECSEL structures, the measurement setup and the data processing method.
